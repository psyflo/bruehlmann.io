Florian's research uses self-reported and behavioral data to examine how digital technologies affect users and how users' experiences with technology can be improved. He uses a mix of innovative, rigorous statistical methodology and qualitative research to shed new light on the challenge of understanding and quantifying users' experiences. He also advocates a broader adoption of Open and Reproducible Science.
