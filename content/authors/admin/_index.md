Florian's research uses self-reported and behavioral data to examine how digital technologies affect users and how user's experiences with technology can be improved. He uses a mix of innovative, rigorous statistical methodology and qualitative research to shed new light on the challenge of understanding and quantifying user's experiences. He also advocates a broader introduction of Open Science and Reproducible Science.

Florian is a PostDoc and the Head of the Human-Computer Interaction research group (mmi-basel.ch) at the Faculty for Psychology, University of Basel.
