 abstract = {Answering important design questions and delivering actionable insights within a couple of days is invaluable. Traditional playtests are often time consuming, expensive and deliver insights based on only a small sample of participants. Crowdsourced playtests may deliver comparable quality of feedback with less resources. However, several aspects have to be considered in order to receive meaningful and actionable results. Based on our experience, we provide five recommendations to ensure data quality and prevent fraud. Taken together, this suggests that crowdsourced playtesting is a promising alternative for indie, non-profit and academic Games User Research.},
