abstract: Answering important design questions and delivering actionable insights
  within a couple of days is invaluable. Traditional playtests are often time consuming,
  expensive and deliver insights based on only a small sample of participants. Crowdsourced
  playtests may deliver comparable quality of feedback with less resources. However,
  several aspects have to be considered in order to receive meaningful and actionable
  results. Based on our experience, we provide five recommendations to ensure data
  quality and prevent fraud. Taken together, this suggests that crowdsourced playtesting
  is a promising alternative for indie, non-profit and academic Games User Research.
