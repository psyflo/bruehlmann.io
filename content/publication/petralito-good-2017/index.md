abstract: Appropriate challenges and challenge-skill balance are usually key to positive
  player experiences. However, some games such as the successful series Dark Souls
  are notorious for their excessive difficulty. Yet, there has been little empirical
  investigation of why players enjoy games they constantly struggle and fail with.
  We surveyed 95 participants right after the release of Dark Souls III about their
  experiences with the game, employing both open questions and different player experience
  measures. Players generally enjoyed challenging play sessions and mostly reported
  positive experiences, with achievement and learning moments strongly contributing
  to positive experiences. However, these factors themselves were enabled by negative
  events such as difficulties and avatar death. Our findings showcase that negative
  events bear a potential for forming positive and meaningful experiences, thus expanding
  previous knowledge about the role of challenge and failing in games. Moreover, the
  significance of hard-earned achievements extends present design conventions.
