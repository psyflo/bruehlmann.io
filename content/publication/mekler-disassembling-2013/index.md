abstract: Interest in gamification is growing steadily. But as the underlying mechanisms
  of gamification are not well understood yet, a closer examination of a gamified
  activity's meaning and individual game design elements may provide more insights.
  We examine the effects of points -- a basic element of gamification, -- and meaningful
  framing -- acknowledging participants' contribution to a scientific cause, -- on
  intrinsic motivation and performance in an online image annotation task. Based on
  these findings, we discuss implications and opportunities for future research on
  gamification.
