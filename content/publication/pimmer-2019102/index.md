abstract: Although Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) is a massive communication phenomenon
  and its educational use can be seen as a genuine form of mobile learning, it has
  been studied to a limited extent to date. The present study examined the use of
  MIM to engage young professionals in mobile learning communities during their school-to-work
  transition. This transition is one of the most central but also challenging developmental
  phases marked by the experience of knowledge gaps and a lack of belonging. To assess
  knowledge and socio-professional learning effects associated with the use of MIM,
  this study adopted a quasi-experimental, survey-based approach with an intervention
  and control condition (n = 114) in the setting of an international research project.
  In the intervention condition, newly graduated nurses from Nigeria participated
  in WhatsApp groups in which moderators shared knowledge and stimulated professional
  discussions over a period of 6 months. Data were collected via online surveys and
  knowledge tests. The findings show that participants in the moderated WhatsApp groups
  had significantly higher knowledge and exhibited fewer feelings of professional
  isolation compared with the control group, which was not subject of any treatment.
  The effects were even more pronounced when controlling for active contributions
  (writing vs reading messages), which also amounted to significantly higher levels
  of professional identification. In addition, across intervention and control groups,
  the self-reported general active use of WhatsApp (outside of the intervention) was
  positively associated with the measures of professional social capital maintained
  with school connections, professional identity, (lower) professional isolation,
  job satisfaction, and the perceived transfer of school knowledge to work practice.
  Whereas knowledge and socio-professional effects can be triggered through moderated
  WhatsApp interventions yet the general (and thus informal) use of WhatsApp is associated
  with socio-professional connectedness. The findings are of particular relevance
  in the developing context under investigation, which is marked by a lack of alternative
  support structures.
