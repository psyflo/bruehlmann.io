abstract: We describe and report the analysis of two widely used questionnaires to
  measure the player experience in digital games. In order to contribute to the further
  validation and meaningful application of the PENS and GEQ we examined the underlying
  factorial structure of both questionnaires. Four hundred and forty-seven participants
  played two different games and rated them on a set of various variables including
  the PENS and GEQ. Consistent with previous research we gained additional insight
  into optimization of both measurements. While the factor structure of the PENS appears
  to be consistent and invariant across two different games, the GEQ reveals weaknesses
  in fulfilling these requirements.
