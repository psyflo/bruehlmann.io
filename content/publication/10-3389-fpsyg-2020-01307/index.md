abstract: Player motivation is a key research area within games research, with the
  aim of understanding how the motivation of players is related to their experience
  and behavior in the game. We present the results of a cross-sectional study with
  data from 750 players of League of Legends, a popular Multiplayer Online Battle
  Arena game. Based on the motivational regulations posited by Self-Determination
  Theory and Latent Profile Analysis, we identify four distinct motivational profiles,
  which differ with regards to player experience and, to a lesser extent, in-game
  behavior. While the more self-determined profiles \"Intrinsic\" and \"Autonomous\" report
  mainly positive experience-related outcomes, a considerable part of the player base
  does not. Players of the \"Amotivated\" and \"External\" profile derive less enjoyment,
  experience more negative affect and tension, and score lower on vitality, indicating
  game engagement that is potentially detrimental to players' well-being. With regards
  to game metrics, minor differences in the rate of assists in unranked matches and
  performance indicators were observed between profiles. This strengthens the notion
  that differences in experiences are not necessarily reflected in differences in
  behavioral game metrics. Our findings provide insights into the interplay of player
  motivation, experience, and in-game behavior, contributing to a more nuanced understanding
  of player-computer interaction.
