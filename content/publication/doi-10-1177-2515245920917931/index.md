abstract: ' Does convincing people that free will is an illusion reduce their sense
  of personal responsibility? Vohs and Schooler (2008) found that participants reading
  from a passage “debunking” free will cheated more on experimental tasks than did
  those reading from a control passage, an effect mediated by decreased belief in
  free will. However, this finding was not replicated by Embley, Johnson, and Giner-Sorolla
  (2015), who found that reading arguments against free will had no effect on cheating
  in their sample. The present study investigated whether hard-to-understand arguments
  against free will and a low-reliability measure of free-will beliefs account for
  Embley et al.’s failure to replicate Vohs and Schooler’s results. Participants (N
  = 621) were randomly assigned to participate in either a close replication of Vohs
  and Schooler’s Experiment 1 based on the materials of Embley et al. or a revised
  protocol, which used an easier-to-understand free-will-belief manipulation and an
  improved instrument to measure free will. We found that the revisions did not matter.
  Although the revised measure of belief in free will had better reliability than
  the original measure, an analysis of the data from the two protocols combined indicated
  that free-will beliefs were unchanged by the manipulations, d = 0.064, 95% confidence
  interval = [−0.087, 0.22], and in the focal test, there were no differences in cheating
  behavior between conditions, d = 0.076, 95% CI = [−0.082, 0.22]. We found that expressed
  free-will beliefs did not mediate the link between the free-will-belief manipulation
  and cheating, and in exploratory follow-up analyses, we found that participants
  expressing lower beliefs in free will were not more likely to cheat in our task. '
