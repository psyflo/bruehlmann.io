abstract: Research on the effectiveness of gamification has proliferated over the
  last few years, but the underlying motivational mechanisms have only recently become
  object of empirical research. It has been suggested that when perceived as informational,
  gamification elements, such as points, levels and leaderboards, may afford feelings
  of competence and hence enhance intrinsic motivation and promote performance gains.
  We conducted a 2 × 4 online experiment that systematically examined how points,
  leaderboards and levels, as well as participants' goal causality orientation influence
  intrinsic motivation, competence and performance (tag quantity and quality) in an
  image annotation task. Compared to a control condition, game elements did not significantly
  affect competence or intrinsic motivation, irrespective of participants' causality
  orientation. However, participants' performance did not mirror their intrinsic motivation,
  as points, and especially levels and leaderboard led to a significantly higher amount
  of tags generated compared to the control group. These findings suggest that in
  this particular study context, points, levels and leaderboards functioned as extrinsic
  incentives, effective only for promoting performance quantity.
