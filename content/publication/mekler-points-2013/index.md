abstract: It is heavily debated within the gamification community whether specific
  game elements may actually undermine users' intrinsic motivation. This online experiment
  examined the effects of three commonly employed game design elements -- points,
  leaderboard, levels -- on users' performance, intrinsic motivation, perceived autonomy
  and competence in an image annotation task. Implementation of these game elements
  significantly increased performance, but did not affect perceived autonomy, competence
  or intrinsic motivation. Our findings suggest that points, levels and leaderboards
  by themselves neither make nor break users' intrinsic motivation in non-game contexts.
  Instead, it is assumed that they act as progress indicators, guiding and enhancing
  user performance. While more research on the contextual factors that may potentially
  mediate the effects of game elements on intrinsic motivation is required, it seems
  that the implementation of points, levels, and leaderboards is a viable means to
  promote specific user behavior in non-game contexts.
