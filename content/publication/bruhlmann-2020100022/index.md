abstract: Despite recent concerns about data quality, various academic fields rely
  increasingly on crowdsourced samples. Thus, the goal of this study was to systematically
  assess carelessness in a crowdsourced sample (N = 394) by applying various measures
  and detection methods. A Latent Profile Analysis revealed that 45.9% of the participants
  showed some form of careless behavior. Excluding these participants increased the
  effect size in an experiment included in the survey. Based on our findings, several
  recommendations of easy to apply measures for assessing data quality are given.
