Die Frage war, <em>wieviele Ausreisser denn bei einer Stichprobengrösse von N=1000 bei einer perfekten Normalverteilung zu erwarten wären</em>. Unter der Diskussion von mutlivariaten Analysemethoden eine durchaus wichtige Frage, da bei vielen Beobachtungen die Wahrscheinlichkeit für Ausreisser steigt. Die Berechnung geht folgendermassen:</p><p>Das Kriterium für Ausreisser ist bei Boxplots meistens 1.5 mal der Interquartilabstand, d.h. der Abstand zwischen dem tiefen (ersten) und dem hohen (dritten) Quartil (das zweite Quartil ist der Median = 50. Percentil).</p><p>Das dritte Quartil (75. Percentil) entspricht dem Wert 0.67 (Aus der Tabelle der <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabelle_Standardnormalverteilung" target="_blank">Standardnomalverteilung</a>). Aufgrund der Symmetrie ist der Interquartilabstand zwischen -0.67 und 0.67, also 1.34. Zwischen diesen beiden Werten liegen 50% der Daten (+/- 0.67 Standardabeichungen). Um den höchsten Wert zu finden, der noch kein Ausreisser ist, addieren wir zum 75. Percentli das 1.5 fache des Interquartilabstands: 0.67 + (1.34 * 1.5) = 2.68 . Wenn wir nun in der Tabelle nachschlagen, finden wir bei 2.68 ein Wahrscheinlichkeit für diesen oder höhere Werte von 0.00368. Da die Ausreisser sowohl im negativen wie auch im positiven Bereich auftreten können, multiplizieren wir diese Wahrscheinlichkeit mit 2.</p><p>Damit erhalten wir 0.00736 was der Wahrscheinlichkeit für das Auftreten von Ausreissern nach dem gängigen Kriterium bei Boxplots (1.5 Kastenhöhe) entspricht. Um die Frage des Dozenten zu beantworten, multiplizieren wir diese Zahl einfach mit der Stichprobengrösse N = 1000 und erhalten dabei 7.36. Bei einer Stichprobengrösse von N = 1000 sind also mehr als 7 Ausreisser zu erwarten – d.h. “normal”! Genau aus diesem Grund ist es nicht immer ratsam, die Ausreisser einfach zu eliminieren. Was aber damit wann und wie gemacht werden muss, ist ein Thema für einen weiteren Blogpost.</p><div style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Boxplot mit Wahrscheinlichkeitsfunktion" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Boxplot_vs_PDF.svg/550px-Boxplot_vs_PDF.svg.png" height="418" width="384"><p class="wp-caption-text">Boxplot mit Wahrscheinlichkeitsfunktion für das Kriterium +/- 1.5*Kastenhöhe (Interquartilrange) Quelle: Wikipedia</p></div> <p>Nachtrag:<br> Diese Wahrscheinlichkeit lässt sich auch sehr einfach mit R berechnen.

However, some games such as the successful series Dark Souls are notorious for their excessive difficulty. Yet, there has been little empiri- cal investigation of why players enjoy games they constantly struggle and fail with. We surveyed 95 participants right after the release of Dark Souls III about their experiences with the game, employing both open questions and different player experience measures. Players generally enjoyed challenging play sessions and mostly reported positive experiences, with achievement and learning moments strongly contributing to positive experiences. However, these factors themselves were enabled by negative events such as difficulties and avatar death. Our findings showcase that negative events bear a potential for forming positive and meaningful experiences, thus expanding previous knowledge about the role of challenge and failing in games. Moreover, the significance of hard-earned achieve- ments extends present design conventions."},{title:"The Effects of Framing in Gamification",subtitle:"A Study of Failure",description:"describe",link:"https://bruehlmann.io/pub/masterthesis_fbruehlmann_final.pdf","abstract":"In human-computer interaction research, interest in the unique experiences that digital games offer is increasing. One characteristic of digital games is the failure of players, which is arguably the core of what makes games interesting and fun. Gamification seems to transfer some of the motivational effects of digital games in non-entertainment contexts by reframing an activity. Hence, this thesis sheds light on the psychological effects of failing in different contexts to gain a better understanding of the effects of games and gamified applications. Two mixed-design experiments (N1 = 148, N2 = 63) were conducted. The first examined the effect of failing in a task, game, test, and task with meaning condition. Participants in this experiment were compensated for participation. In the second experiment, the framing conditions task, game, and test were examined, and no compensation was given for participation. Results showed that framing an activity as a game did not reduce the negative effect of failing on intrinsic motivation. However, having additional information about the task seemed to buffer the negative effect of failing on positive affect in the first experiment. Furthermore, perceived value and particularly change in autonomy was found to predict playing of additional rounds after the study."},{title:"Measuring User Rated Language Quality: Development and Validation of the User Interface Language Quality Survey (LQS)",subtitle:"",description:"describe",link:"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581915001445","abstract":"Written text plays a special role in user interfaces. Key information in interaction elements and content are mostly conveyed through text. The global context, where software has to run in multiple geographical and cultural regions, requires software developers to translate their interfaces into many different languages. This translation process is prone to errors – therefore the question of how language quality can be measured is important. This article presents the development of a questionnaire to measure user interface language quality (LQS). After a first validation of the instrument with 843 participants, a final set of 10 items remained, which was tested again (N=690). The survey showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's α) of .82, acceptable discriminatory power coefficients (.34 – .47), as well as a moderate average homogeneity of .36. The LQS also showed moderate correlation to UMUX, an established usability metric (convergent validity), and it successfully distinguished high and low language quality (discriminative validity). The application to three different products (YouTube, Google Analytics, Google AdWords) revealed similar key statistics, providing evidence that this survey is product-independent. Meanwhile, the survey has been translated and applied to more than 60 languages."},{title:"Towards Understanding the Effects of Individual Gamification Elements on Intrinsic Motivation and Performance",subtitle:"",description:"describe",link:"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215301229","abstract":"Research on the effectiveness of gamification has proliferated over the last few years, but the underlying motivational mechanisms have only recently become object of empirical research. It has been suggested that when perceived as informational, gamification elements, such as points, levels and leaderboards, may afford feelings of competence and hence enhance intrinsic motivation and promote performance gains. We conducted a 2 × 4 online experiment that systematically examined how points, leaderboards and levels, as well as participants' goal causality orientation influence intrinsic motivation, competence and performance (tag quantity and quality) in an image annotation task. Compared to a control condition, game elements did not significantly affect competence or intrinsic motivation, irrespective of participants' causality orientation. However, participants' performance did not mirror their intrinsic motivation, as points, and especially levels and leaderboard led to a significantly higher amount of tags generated compared to the control group. These findings suggest that in this particular study context, points, levels and leaderboards functioned as extrinsic incentives, effective only for promoting performance quantity."},{title:"How to Measure the Game Experience? Analysis of the Factor Structure of Two Questionnaires",subtitle:"",description:"describe",link:"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2732831","abstract":"We describe and report the analysis of two widely used questionnaires to measure the player experience in digital games. In order to contribute to the further validation and meaningful application of the PENS and GEQ we examined the underlying factorial structure of both questionnaires. Four hundred and forty-seven participants played two different games and rated them on a set of various variables including the PENS and GEQ. Consistent with previous research we gained additional insight into optimization of both measurements. While the factor structure of the PENS appears to be consistent and invariant across two different games, the GEQ reveals weaknesses in fulfilling these requirements."},{title:"Disassembling Gamification: The Effects of Points and Meaning on User Motivation and Performance",subtitle:"",description:"describe",link:"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2468559","abstract":"Interest in gamification is growing steadily.

An empirical analysis of common gamification elements",description:"second describe","abstract":"It is heavily debated within the gamification community whether specific game elements may actually undermine users' intrinsic motivation. This online experiment examined the effects of three commonly employed game design elements -- points, leaderboard, levels -- on users' performance, intrinsic motivation, perceived autonomy and competence in an image annotation task. Implementation of these game elements significantly increased performance, but did not affect perceived autonomy, competence or intrinsic motivation. Our findings suggest that points, levels and leaderboards by themselves neither make nor break users' intrinsic motivation in non-game contexts. Instead, it is assumed that they act as progress indicators, guiding and enhancing user performance. While more research on the contextual factors that may potentially mediate the effects of game elements on intrinsic motivation is required, it seems that the implementation of points, levels, and leaderboards is a viable means to promote specific user behavior in non-game contexts.",link:"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2583017"},{title:"Gamification From the Perspective of Self-Determination Theory and Flow","abstract":'In human-computer interaction, the trend towards gamification is part of the shift of focus from usability to the more holistic approach of user experience. Gamification is "the use of game elements in non-game contexts" and is increasingly used in a variety of domains such as crowd sourcing, health care, sustainability, sports and learning. In today’s Internet, consumer loyalty is low and high expectations are placed upon positive effects of gamification. Despite its widespread use, only a small number of studies have examined the phenomenon empirically and it is still unclear if and how gamification is able to live up to expectations. A promising approach is to study gamification from the perspective of motivation theories. The extensive research on rewards and research in the field of video games makes the theory of self-determination a viable starting point. Likewise, the concept of flow has strengths when it comes to designing for an optimal user experience and usability. Following the approach of self-determination theory, the possible effects of personal, situational and contextual factors will be discussed and recommendations for design and possible research will be given.',link:"https://bruehlmann.io/pub/fbruehlmann_bachelorthesis_final.pdf"}]}]),angular.module("bruehlmannioApp").controller("ContactCtrl",["$scope",function(a){a.awesomeThings=["HTML5 Boilerplate","AngularJS","Karma"]}]);
