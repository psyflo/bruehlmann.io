 <p><strong>Amotivation</strong> is the state of lacking the intention to act. When people are amotivated, either they do not act at all or they act passively - that is, they go through the motions with no sense of intending to do what they are doing.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p><strong>External regulation</strong> is the least autonomous form of extrinsic motivation and includes the classic instance of being motivated to obtain rewards or avoid punishment. More generally, external regulation is in evidence when one’s reason for doing a behavior is to satisfy an external demand or a socially constructed contingency.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p><strong>Introjected regulation</strong> involves an external regulation having been internalized but not, in a much deeper sense, truly accepted as one’s own. It is a type of extrinsic motivation that, having been partially internalized, is within the person but is not considered part of the integrated self. Introjection-based behaviors are performed to avoid guilt and shame or to attain ego enhancements and feelings of worth.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p><strong>Regulation through identification</strong> is a more self-determined form of extrinsic motivation, for it involves a conscious valuing of a behavioral goal or regulation, an acceptance of the behavior as personally important. When a person identifies with an action or the value it expresses, they, at least at a conscious level, are personally endorsing it, and thus identifications are accompanied by a high degree of perceived autonomy.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p><strong>Integrated regulation</strong> results when identifications have evaluated and brought into congruence with the personally endorsed values, goals and needs that are already part of the self.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p><strong>Intrinsically motivated</strong> behaviors are those whose motivation is based in the inherent satisfaction of the behavior per se, rather than in contingencies or reinforcements that are operationally separable from those activities. People engage in activities freely, being sustained by the experience of interest and enjoyment.</p>
